next steps: 

game should be played in a confined space, not too large. 

items - 

you can move the player around to pick up items.

keep it simple; 


create item spawner tile and place them down in the editor, same as the enemy spawners.


in the game, 'extract the tiles" and store their positions in a grid? list? -> some container in which its entities can be queried efficiently, 

probs spatial grid again. 


then, -> create a timer in the main game loop.


when the timer ticks a certain amount, spawn enemies and items. 


FIRST DO THE ITEMS. 

ITEMS ARE first created in as a pool. When the timer ticks, get the container at the current index, and ENABLE IT. There should also then be a container containing all the enabled items. 

The enabled items are then rendered and processed by the physics and render systems. 

The items you should do now: 

ak 47, the pistol, and rest are just power - ups ; rate of fire, damage, and ammo. 

when the player collides with the items, the items are picked up.
