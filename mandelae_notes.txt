1. create the ak47 firing, 

input handler - gets the mouse click 


if clicked, then prompt the entity manager to shoot out a new bullet entity, and create the bullet entity pool similar to how you did it for

weapon is fired with a specific fire rate, and 


bullet collision, and effects on collision .

- add dynamic lights 









2. add pickups for power ups on collision
