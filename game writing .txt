game writing: 

shoot em all.

Noel: 

it was gonna be about a soldier going on an adventure in a distraught world, overflown with different aliens, or creatures. 

to save his dog. 

and the dog's name or this guy's name is Noel. 



what is my Game's 'special' or 'main' game characteristic, what is the hook?

- create one gameplay mechanic that is going to be dyanmic, and fun. - 

that the game will revolve around. 

collectable items - teleportation - slow down the game,  then you can click on a certain point to teleport to. 

			  jetpack  - boosting, horitontal dash,  

weapons  -	 default weapon - 'ak' - infinite ammo 
	      - can pickup cool weapons that aliens use. 


'infections'  - can contain blood of enemies, 

		- when you drink the blood, you gain their special abilities for a certain amount of time.

 



first setting will be the day of the 'happening',

Noel will wake up his dog missing, and will go out to save it.  - This will be the demo.
